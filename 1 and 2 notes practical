# Hadoop HDFS File Management – Practical Implementation

## 📌 Aim

To implement basic file management operations in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) such as creating directories, uploading files, retrieving files, viewing contents, and deleting files.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* Hadoop (Hortonworks Sandbox)
* HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
* Oracle VM VirtualBox
* Ambari Dashboard
* SSH Terminal / Browser SSH

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Procedure

### 1️⃣ Start Hadoop Sandbox

* Open VirtualBox.
* Start Hortonworks Sandbox virtual machine.
* Wait until all services initialize.

---

### 2️⃣ Open Ambari Dashboard

Access Hadoop services UI:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Login Credentials:

```
Username: admin
Password: admin
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start HDFS Services

Navigate to:

```
Services → HDFS → Service Actions → Start All
```

This starts:

* NameNode
* DataNode
* Secondary NameNode

Ensure all components turn **green (Running)**.

---

### 4️⃣ Open SSH Terminal

Access sandbox terminal via browser SSH or PuTTY.

Login:

```
Username: maria_dev
Password: maria_dev
```

---

## 📂 HDFS File Management Commands

### 5️⃣ List Root Directories

```bash
hadoop fs -ls /
```

Displays directories in HDFS root.

---

### 6️⃣ Create Directory

```bash
hadoop fs -mkdir ml-100k
```

Creates a folder in HDFS.

---

### 7️⃣ Verify Directory Creation

```bash
hadoop fs -ls /
```

---

### 8️⃣ Download Dataset to Local System

```bash
wget http://media.sundog-soft.com/hadoop/ml-100k/u.data
```

Downloads MovieLens dataset.

---

### 9️⃣ Verify Downloaded File

```bash
ls
```

---

### 🔟 Upload File to HDFS

```bash
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal u.data ml-100k/u.data
```

Copies file from local system to HDFS.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Verify File Upload

```bash
hadoop fs -ls ml-100k
```

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ View File Content

```bash
hadoop fs -cat ml-100k/u.data | head
```

Displays first few records of dataset.

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Retrieve File from HDFS (Optional)

```bash
hadoop fs -copyToLocal ml-100k/u.data
```

Downloads file back to local system.

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Delete File from HDFS

```bash
hadoop fs -rm ml-100k/u.data
```

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Delete Directory

```bash
hadoop fs -rmdir ml-100k
```

Removes directory from HDFS.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used is the **MovieLens dataset**.

Each record contains:

| Field     | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| User ID   | Unique user identifier  |
| Movie ID  | Unique movie identifier |
| Rating    | User rating (1–5)       |
| Timestamp | Time of rating          |

---

## ✅ Result

Successfully started HDFS services and implemented file management operations including directory creation, file upload, retrieval, content viewing, and deletion using Hadoop Distributed File System.
